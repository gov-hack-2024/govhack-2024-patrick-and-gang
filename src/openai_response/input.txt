Where the extra $4.7 billion in gender-based violence funding is going

Australians fleeing domestic violence will soon receive additional support as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a $4.7 billion boost in funding.

Albanese met with premiers and chief ministers on Friday morning to discuss what he's repeatedly labelled a "national crisis", and reassert his government's commitment to end family, domestic and sexual violence "in a generation".

Forty-seven women have been violently killed in Australia since the start of the year, according to the advocacy group Destroy the Joint's project Counting Dead Women.

The prime minister said it was crucial to have an "all hands on deck" approach, with collaboration between states, territories, and the federal government essential.
