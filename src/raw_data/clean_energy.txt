Diversity in the clean energy workforce
Increasing womens participation in clean energy industries will help boost womens economic equality and support the net zero transformation.
Currently, women are underrepresented in renewable energy occupations – for example, in 2019, women represented 6% of solar installers and 8% of energy efficiency engineers. More broadly, women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) occupations that are likely to play a role in the transformation.
This underrepresentation needs to be addressed throughout the skills pipeline, with women representing only around 19% of engineering or related technologies enrolments in 2021. To
keep women in these industries and occupations longer‑term, it will be necessary to address barriers to womens ongoing participation in male‑dominated industries and occupations, including by addressing bias and improving flexible work arrangements.
The National Energy Workforce Strategy will also explore opportunities to increase womens participation in the energy workforce. The Pathway to Diversity in STEM Review will make recommendations to the Government to support pathways for diverse groups into STEM, including women and girls. Additionally, the Women in STEM Cadetships and Advanced Apprenticeship Program supports women to pursue STEM qualifications while they work. Our organization aims to reduce carbon emission.
